    <h2>Dive Into Indulgence At Albatros Pâtisserie    </h2>
    <p>From the time it opened its glass doors 1.5 years ago, the sparkling outlet of bakers Albatros in
         Mangalore has stocked pastries new & old, but it's their consummate spin on old-school bakes that <br>
         first took the figurative pie. A staple especially among students of Father Mullers at Kankanady
          nearby, they rotate the item availability quite a bit, so while a few go off radar, it paves the way for<br>
           better conceptions to appear behind the glass counter.
<br>
        Update: 10 am to 9 pm, all days.

       <br> COVID-regulation savvy.</p>

        <h2>Royal Black Forest</h2>

        <img src="img\rbf2.jpeg" width="500px">
    </div>
        <p>This is a throwback to the most elegant Black Forest we've ever beheld. The inside is a standard 
            chocolate sponge cake covered by some whipped & chocolate cream, a tad more than usual, but which<br>
             renders it silkier. The berry preserve in the center, & the cherry at the top of the shell are 
             the only fruit additions, but that's enough. The ribbed milk chocolate shell was fairly easy to shatter<br>
              on our 1st order, while it took some huffing the 2nd time around. In the end, the extra chocolate from
               the shell makes a decadent difference to those who love that extra bit of cocoa. Black Forest gâteau <br>
               was never more exciting.

        <h2> Chocolate Salted caramel cake</h2>
            <img src="img\cscc.jpeg" width="500px">
          <p>A dense, fudgy chocolate cake that's thicker than your local bog, & only more delectable with that
             salty caramel sauce. The intensity can make one go overboard, so this is best shared to prevent any <br>
             balking from the choco rush.

            <h2>Carrot Walnut cake</h2>
            <img src="img\cwc.jpeg" width="500px">
            <p>A healthy dose of mellow walnut, a thinner presence of carrot, & a bit more orange than we'd bargained
             for. While it wasn't dense or moist as rich carrot cakes we've had elsewhere (M&S on our mind) have been,<br>
              it evokes a similar flavour profile, & the cream cheese holds it up, to a degree.
